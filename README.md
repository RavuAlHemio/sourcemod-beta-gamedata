# SourceMod gamedata for beta games #

This project aims to provide [SourceMod](http://www.sourcemod.net/) gamedata
definitions for beta versions of games.

## How to use ##

Each file contains usage instructions. You are probably interested in the
contents of the `ALL` directory as well as the directory of the game you are
hosting.

## Credits ##

Credit goes to Fyren and psychonic for their `gdc` tool.
